# Segment Anything in 3D with NeRF (SA3D)

This repo is for the official code of [SA3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10261). 

We present a project in which we lift the superpowers of [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to 3D based on neural radiance fields. This project is still in progress, and the code will be released soon. 

More demos can be found in our [project page](https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/).
